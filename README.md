# sudoku_solver
A program that solves classical sudokus. I quickly wrote this because I was bored.

The program will probably not be able to solve very hard sudokus, since "advanced" sudoku logic (pairs, triples, x-wings, ...) has not been implemented yet. It will be able to solve every sudoku which you would consider easy or medium and almost all hard sudokus.
